A beginner's roadmap for learning SQL:

🔹Understand Basics:
Learn what SQL is and its purpose in managing relational databases.
Understand basic database concepts like tables, rows, columns, and relationships.

🔹Learn SQL Syntax:
Familiarize yourself with SQL syntax for common commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Understand clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and JOIN.

🔹Setup a Database:
Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL.
Practice creating databases, tables, and inserting data.

🔹Retrieve Data (SELECT):
Learn to retrieve data from a database using SELECT statements.
Practice filtering data using WHERE clause and sorting using ORDER BY.

🔹Modify Data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
Understand how to insert new records, update existing ones, and delete data.
Be cautious with DELETE to avoid unintentional data loss.

🔹Working with Functions:
Explore SQL functions like COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN for data analysis.
Understand string functions, date functions, and mathematical functions.

🔹Data Filtering and Sorting:
Learn advanced filtering techniques using AND, OR, and IN operators.
Practice sorting data using multiple columns.

🔹Table Relationships (JOIN):
Understand the concept of joining tables to retrieve data from multiple tables.
Learn about INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

🔹Grouping and Aggregation:
Explore GROUP BY clause to group data based on specific columns.
Understand aggregate functions for summarizing data (SUM, AVG, COUNT).

🔹Subqueries:
Learn to use subqueries to perform complex queries.
Understand how to use subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses.

🔹Indexes and Optimization:
Gain knowledge about indexes and their role in optimizing queries.
Understand how to optimize SQL queries for better performance.

🔹Transactions and ACID Properties:
Learn about transactions and the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
Understand how to use transactions to maintain data integrity.

🔹Normalization:
Understand the basics of database normalization to design efficient databases.
Learn about 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.

🔹Backup and Recovery:
Understand the importance of database backups.
Learn how to perform backups and recovery operations.

🔹Practice and Projects:
Apply your knowledge through hands-on projects.
Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or build your own small database-driven projects.
