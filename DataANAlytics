SAS's iterative process
An iterative data analysis process was created by a company called SAS,
 a leading data analytics solutions provider. 
It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

1.Ask

2.Prepare

3.Explore

4.Model

5.Implement

6.Act

7.Evaluate

The six phases of data analysis

The data analysis process helps analysts break down business problems into a series of manageable tasks: 

In the ask phase, you’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be  answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you’ll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

Next, in the prepare phase, you’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You’ll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions. 

The process phase is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, you’re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

The analyze phase is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

Next comes the share phase, when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R. 

Last is the act phase, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem.

Project-based data analytics process 
A project-based data analytics process has five simple steps:

1.Identifying the problem

2.Designing data requirements

3.Pre-processing data

4.Performing data analysis

5.Visualizing data

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big data analytics process
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, 
Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their process suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1.Business case evaluation

2.Data identification

3.Data acquisition and filtering

4.Data extraction

5.Data validation and cleaning 

6.Data aggregation and representation

7.Data analysis

8.Data visualization

9.Utilization of analysis results

Data Ecosystem
Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to 
produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.

Data and gut instinct
Key takeaways
Data analysts and detectives share a similar approach to problem-solving, both relying on evidence and facts to make decisions. Data-driven decision-making is essential for analysts, but gut instinct can also play a role in identifying patterns and connections. Balancing data and gut instinct is crucial for making informed decisions, and the right mix depends on the project's goals and time constraints.
