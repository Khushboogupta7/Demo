A--> Acid properties
	Useful in ecommerce and financial sectors


1.Atomicity :  ALL OR NONE
	    Transaction executed fully or none


2.Consistency: Measurement of correctness

	A = 100
	B = 300
	---------
	A = 50
	B = 350

 Data items is valid before and after transaction is 400 hence  consistent

3.Isolation : Multiple transaction can occur simultaeneously without interfering each other

Executrs alone, (doesnt get idea or affected

 )irrespective of any transactions happening

 transactions T1,T2,T3,T4
 None of transaction should affect T1
 T1 Should execute isolated

4.Durability:
Once transaction is commited it is permanent , even if system fails, the changes in transactions are stores permanenlty.
  When the transaction is updated with new value , store it       	in database permanently, becomes durable.
